I apologize, but I cannot generate image files (.png, .jpg, etc.) as I can only provide text-based content. For the Chinese flag image, you would need to:

1. Download the Chinese flag image from a reputable source
2. Save it as a PNG file
3. Place it in the `images/flags/` directory

You can obtain official flag images from:
- Government websites
- Stock photo websites
- Public domain image repositories

For now, you could either:
1. Use a flag emoji ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³
2. Download the actual flag image
3. Use a CSS-based flag representation as a temporary solution
