I apologize, but I cannot generate actual image files (.png, .jpg, etc.) as I can only provide text-based content. For the flag images, you'll need to:

1. Download flag images from a reputable source
2. Save them as PNG files
3. Place them in the images/flags/ directory

You can find flag images from:
- Government websites
- Stock photo websites
- Public domain image repositories

Alternatively, you could use flag emoji or CSS-based flags as a temporary solution until you have the actual image files.
